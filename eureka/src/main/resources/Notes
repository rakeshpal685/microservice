All the services that are registered with Eureka will also maintain their own cache of the services that are
registered with Eureka.

When my service is registered for the very first time it will call localhost://ipOfEureka/eureka/apps/ internally
to see all the registered services

Once the service is registered then it will call localhost://ipOfEureka/eureka/apps/delta to see just any new
services got registered or not. It will not fetch the whole list of registered service once again. It does so
along with the sending of heartbeat
